          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-3">ðŸ‘¤ Professional Summary</h2>
          <p>
            I am a postgraduate student pursuing <b>Robotics and Artificial
            Intelligence</b> at Ramaiah Institute of Technology, Bangalore.
            Curiosity for intelligent systems and automation drives me to blend{" "}
            <b>AI with hardware</b> to create real-world solutions. I am deeply
            motivated, eager to learn, and committed to lifelong growth in
            technology and innovation.

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-3">ðŸŽ“ Education</h2>
          <p>
            My academic journey began with a <b>B.E. in Electrical and
            Electronics Engineering</b> at BMS Institute of Technology and
            Management, Bangalore, where I graduated with a CGPA of <b>8.33</b>.
            During this time, I worked on projects like a line-following
            firefighting robot and a gesture-based wheelchair, which sparked my
            passion for robotics.
          </p>
          <p>
            Currently, I am pursuing my <b>M.Tech in Robotics and AI</b> at
            Ramaiah Institute of Technology, where I secured a CGPA of{" "}
            <b>9.59</b> in my first semester. This program continues to refine
            my expertise in machine learning, embedded systems, and intelligent
            automation.

        {/* Work Experience */}
        <section>
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-3">ðŸ’¼ Work Experience</h2>
          <p>
            From 2022 to 2025, I worked at <b>JSW Steel, Vijayanagar</b>. My
            role gave me hands-on exposure to industrial automation, drives, and
            leadership. I led a team of fourteen engineers to assemble and
            commission a 35-ton grab-type EOT crane, ensuring a zero-delay
            startup.
          </p>
          <p>
            By automating workflows with <b>SAP, Excel, and Power BI</b>, I cut
            manual effort by 60% and built dashboards for real-time monitoring.
            My contributions reduced crane downtime from five hours a week to
            less than half an hour. For these achievements, I was honored with
            an <b>Exemplary Award</b> and earned{" "}
            <b>fast-track probation clearance</b>.
          </p>
          <p>
            My time at JSW also included representing the company at the{" "}
            <b>G20 Summit in Hampi</b> and during Silver Jubilee celebrations,
            where I took on leadership roles beyond technical contributions.

          <p>
            An AI-powered firefighting robot with Raspberry Pi for real-time
            fire detection and adaptive extinguishing, a fruit detection robot
            using Jetson Nano and YOLOv8, an ESP32-based rover that follows a
            smartphone via BLE tracking, and weld defect detection systems
            running on Jetson Nano. I have also worked on smart utility
            monitoring with ESP32 and SIM800C, pathfinding simulators using ACO,
            and renewable energy solutions like flexible DSSC solar cells.
